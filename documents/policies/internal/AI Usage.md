# WCA AI Usage Guidelines

### Version 1.0 {.version}

## Purpose

Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to enhance productivity and research. This document provides guidelines for appropriate AI usage when performing work for the World Cube Association.

## Guidelines

1. WCA Approved Tools: Only use approved AI tools provided through the WCA's license while logged into your WCA account. Information input into AI tools provided by the WCA are not used to train or improve AI models. Never input WCA information into AI tools that are accessed under a personal license.
2. Intellectual Property: Respect copyright and IP laws. Be aware that AI-generated content may have unclear ownership.
3. Transparency: In internal and external communications, be clear about when and how AI was used.
4. Fact Check: Always verify critical facts, figures, and citations against primary, trusted sources. Treat AI output as a helpful but unverified first draft.
5. Context is Key: Ensure the AI's output is appropriate for the context you're using it in. A summary for a lab meeting requires a different standard from a paragraph in a manuscript.
6. Fairness and Bias: Actively look for and correct biases in AI outputs.
7. Ethical Use: Be mindful of applicable ethical, legal, and other requirements. This includes all WCA policies, including the Code of Conduct. For example, it is prohibited to use AI to create deceptive content like deepfakes.
8. Human Oversight: AI should not be the final decision-maker for important processes, such as clinical decisions, hiring, or financial approvals. AI should not control systems autonomously where a human-in-the-loop is required for safety or compliance.
9. Accountability: You are responsible for the final work product, regardless of AI assistance.
10. Third-party collaboration: Research collaborations with third parties, including AI-related projects involving the sharing of data or software, require a formal legal agreement. Please contact Legal for advice.
